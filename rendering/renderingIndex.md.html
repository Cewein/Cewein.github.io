Real Time raytracing
===============================================================================

[Setting up the environment](/rtrt-part1.md.html)

!!!WARNING: In progress
    this part is in progress of writting

This part describe how to setup a simple OpenGL environment with shader compilation.
We also are going to explore a bit of ImGui for a small user interface and a way to send data to the GPU.

There will also be a setup for a camera and mouse/keyboard control.

This part is dedicated to raytracing and his younger brother but yet more realistic pathtracing. 
We are going to explore how to render simple primitives (sphere, triangle and cube), with a sky box or with light and how to use the camera to make depth of field.
how to have physically based material (lamber, dielectric, metal and many more) and how to manage the data send for to the GPU.

the optimization part is left for the another time. here we are just going to use a very simple time accumulation rendering system.

This is the advance part, we are going to explore the world of Bounding Volume herachies, and also how to make it more realtime by adding Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Variance Guided Filtering.
