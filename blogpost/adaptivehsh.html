**Adaptive Material-Aware Hemispherical Harmonics Interpolation for Inverse Rendering**

# Abstract

We present a novel theorical approach for efficient representation and interpolation of complex materials in inverse physically based rendering using adaptive hemispherical harmonics.
The method automatically adjusts the HSH basis order based on local material properties and spatial variation, significantly reducing the computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy.
We introduce an adaptation criteria based on the BRDF property and hybrid Hemispherical Harmonics with wavelets.
We then use this adapation criteria to create Material aware ligth-tracing. 

# Introduction

Inverse rendering aims to recover material properties, lighting conditions and geometry to match a desiered output, but faces significant challenges when dealing with complex, spatially-varying materials. 
Traditional approaches that use basis function often use fixed-order basis functions to represent hemispherical quantities, leading to either excessive computational cost or loss of high-frequency details. 
While hemispherical harmonics provide an efficient basis for representing hemispherical functions.
