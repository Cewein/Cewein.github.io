<p><strong>Adaptive Material-Aware Hemispherical Harmonics Interpolation
for Inverse Rendering</strong></p>
<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>We present a novel theorical approach for efficient representation
and interpolation of complex materials in inverse physically based
rendering using adaptive hemispherical harmonics. The method
automatically adjusts the HSH basis order based on local material
properties and spatial variation, significantly reducing the
computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. We introduce an
adaptation criteria based on the BRDF property and hybrid Hemispherical
Harmonics with wavelets. We then use this adapation criteria to create
Material aware ligth-tracing.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Inverse rendering aims to recover material properties, lighting
conditions and geometry to match a desiered output, but faces
significant challenges when dealing with complex, spatially-varying
materials. Traditional approaches that use basis function often use
fixed-order basis functions to represent hemispherical quantities,
leading to either excessive computational cost or loss of high-frequency
details. While hemispherical harmonics provide an efficient basis for
representing hemispherical functions.</p>

Basis</h1>
<p>Our key insight is that the required HSH order varies significantly
based on both material properties and spatial location. The adaptation
of the basis order is particularly crucial for materials with varying
specular responses and complex layering effects. We introduce an
adaptive framework that automatically determines the appropriate local
basis order through a comprehensive analysis of material properties and
local geometry.</p>
